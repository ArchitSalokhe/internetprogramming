        <p>A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent 
            ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded
            privately, such as shares of private  companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment is usually 
            made with an investment strategy in mind.

            The total market capitalization of all publicly traded securities worldwide rose from US$2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$93.7 trillion at the end of 2020.[1]

            As of 2016, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world. Of these, there are 16 exchanges with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more, and they account for 87% of global market capitalization. Apart from the Australian Securities Exchange, these 16 exchanges are all in North America, Europe, or Asia.[2]

            By country, the largest stock markets as of January 2021 are in the United States of America (about 55.9%), followed by Japan (about 7.4%) and China (about 5.4%)

            A stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse) where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares (equity stock), bonds, and 
            other securities. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more
            ttractive to many investors.

            The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. These and other stocks may also be traded "over 
            the counter" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different 
            countries, so as to attract international investors
