        <h1>Information</h1>
        A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic
        radiation such as light – can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact 
        mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although 
        it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features 
        according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.
         Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with 
        the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order
        of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

        <h1>Properties and structure</h1>
        The no-hair theorem postulates that, once it achieves a stable condition after formation, a black hole has only three independent
        physical properties: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum; the black hole is otherwise featureless. If the conjecture is true, any
        two black holes that share the same values for these properties, or parameters, are indistinguishable from one another. The degree to
        which the conjecture is true for real black holes under the laws of modern physics is currently an unsolved problem.

        <h1>Formation and evolution</h1>
        Given the bizarre character of black holes, it was long questioned whether such objects could actually exist in nature or whether they were merely pathological solutions to Einstein's
        equations. Einstein himself wrongly thought black holes would not form, because he held that the angular momentum of collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some 
        radius.[118] This led the general relativity community to dismiss all results to the contrary for many years. However, a minority of relativists continued to contend that black holes were
        physical objects,[119] and by the end of the 1960s, they had persuaded the majority of researchers in the field that there is no obstacle to the formation of an event horizon.

        <h1>History</h1>
        The idea of a body so big that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by English astronomical pioneer and clergyman John Michell in a letter published in November 1784. Michell's simplistic calculations assumed such a body might have the same 
        density as the Sun, and concluded that one would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor of 500, and its surface escape velocity exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell referred to these bodies as dark stars. He correctly noted 
        that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies Scholars of the time were initially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible 'dark stars' might be hiding 
        in plain view, but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent in the early nineteenth century, as if light were a wave rather than a particle, it was unclear what, if any, influence gravity would have on escaping light waves.
