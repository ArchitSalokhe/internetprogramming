<p>The word pollution was derived from the Latin word pollution, which means to make dirty. 
    Pollution is the process of making the environment pollute the water and the air by adding 
    harmful substances. Pollution causes an imbalance in the environment. This imbalance threatened 
    the very survival of all forms of life. It's a threat to the whole world. India ranks at the 
    bottom of 125 of the 132 countries in the 2012 Environmental Performance Index. This report 
    is produced by researchers at Yale and Columbia University in association with the World Economic Forum.</p>

    <p>Pollution of the environment is a serious problem of industrialized societies. Industrial development and 
    the green revolution have had a negative impact on the environment. People have converted the life support 
    system of all living people into their own resources and have greatly disrupted the natural ecological balance.</p>
